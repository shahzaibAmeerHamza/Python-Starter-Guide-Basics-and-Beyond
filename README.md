# Python-Starter-Guide-Basics-and-Beyond
Sort of a Python guidebook by me for beginners, covering basics like variables, loops, and functions, along with an introduction to libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. Includes practical examples and hands-on exercises, making it ideal for learning Python programming and data analysis fundamentals.
